## Problem Statement

The depletion of Water Resources: Cultivating high-water-demand crops can lead to excessive depletion of both underground and surface water sources.

Economic Losses: Cultivating high-water-demand crops in water-scarce regions results in agriculture being economically unsustainable.

Sinkhole Formation: Unconscious water consumption exacerbates the issue.

## Our Objective

Through analysis based on factors such as the location of the plot, the status of water resources, and soil conditions:

To mitigate uncontrolled irrigation practices in agriculture.

To provide relevant information to municipal/government officials regarding the status of fields and gardens in respective districts and neighborhoods.

To enhance agricultural policies and irrigation practices for greater effectiveness.

To enable citizens to determine suitable crops for their gardens or fields through analysis.

## Our Solution

Utilizing artificial intelligence, we provide farmers and governmental institutions with web and mobile applications offering regional climate and soil analyses, along with compatible crop recommendations. This encourages water conservation and promotes sustainable agricultural practices.
